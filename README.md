# LendbuzzTask
Lendbuzz QA task 

Instructions for running the tests:

1. Clone the code to your local machine.
2. Open VSCode (or anyother IDE you're using) and open the project (LendbuzzTask).
3. The tests are located under **tests/todo.spec.ts** (open the file).
4. You can automatically run the tests by doing one of the following:
   
   A. Open the terminal and type - **npx playwright test**
      The tests will start running behind the scenes and will output results of passed / fail.
      To actually watch the tests running on browsers,
      type - **npx playwright test --headed** (tests will run on 3 different browsers).
   
   B. To open a dedicated UI tests platform to watch all the tests run and track results,
      type - **npx playwright test --ui**
   
   C. To run tests directly through VSCode IDE - there's a Lab bottle button on the left, click it and you can run tests from there (notice green play buttons will be added next to the tests code, you can run tests also by clicking on it).
   
5. Good Luck!
